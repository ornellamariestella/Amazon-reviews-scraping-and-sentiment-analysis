0,This vest is a very nice option for someone not looking break the bank. It comes with a bladder for hydration and the phone pocket fits my phone with it's case and pop socket! The material is comfortable and the best doesn't feel heavy when everything is loaded into it. The only con I find to this vest is that the straps can loosen up as you run. I had to tighten them a few times during last run.,5.0,4,none
1,"I previously ordered a running bus from a different vendor and it was nice, but I needed something a little bit more quality and black. I took a chance on this one and let me tell you for the price that I got it for it felt like an expensive Lululemon dupe! I love the pockets and the cell phone holder that it comes with. The fit is comfortable as well, not too tight and washed well.",5.0,4,none
2,"Love all of the pockets! Great fit. It does get loose easily while I’m running , but it’s easy to tighten up.",4.0,5,none
3,"i like this vest a lot! its super light and it fits perfectly on me.does not rub against my skin or leave marks.comes with a water bottle that you can fill up.you can fit you phone in the pocket as well and room for your keys with a zipper.theres also  a pocket in the back for you to keep stuff in.i think this is a good purchase for a runners vest if you dont want to carry much.i just need my keys, phone and water and chap stick and credit card.",5.0,5,none
4,"so happy with my purchase!! It’s so lightweight and has a bunch of pockets/ hideaway zippers, it also includes a collapsible water bottle which is great! But it also can hold a regular plastic water bottle. Everything stays secure and even has room to keep ur phone on you with a sweat shielding touch screen.",5.0,5,none
5,I really liked the vest but it didn't come with the water bottle. I would really like to get the correct item with the water bottle so I can use it.,3.0,3,none
6,It’s my first running vest actually and I love it! Holds my keys and iPhone perfectly. Love that I can pull the phone tab down and change my podcast/music so easily through the clear plastic cover. Fits comfortably and is light weight. It’s great quality and so affordable! Happy I found this.,5.0,5,none
7,"The vest works great but if you’re smaller than a medium sized shirt, it will probably be slightly big on you. I like that it comes with a bottle and the cell phone holder. During a run the straps started to loosen around the 2 mile mark, but I could easily tighten them while running. Overall great value.",4.0,4,none
8,"I bought this cause I saw someone with one and thought I'd try one out. Not only has this been great for me but it frees up my hands. First off, the bottle that this vest comes with can be placed in my freezer to make sure I have cold water in this heat. The one thing I didn't realize is the phone holder pocket because I don't have to attempt to grab my phone out, I just pull it down and can check my notifications. There are so many other pockets that I can just put my keys inside one, and my card holder in another. I found that with the large back pocket, I can fit a flat ice pack inside to help me stay cool. The vest is completely washable and is surprisingly very comfortable and breathable.",5.0,4,none
9,This vest is the bomb! And for my bigger chested girlies in case y’all was wondering it fits mine (38DD) that was my biggest concern finding a vest so I took a chance on this one lol and it’s very comfortable even a tad bit of stretch. 10/10,5.0,5,none
10,"I took this vest for a run today. It made my run very enjoyable! I had my water, my inhaler, and my phone. The phone pocket is very impressive. You put your phone in and the face recognition still works and you can type, if needed. When you’re done, the Velcro holds it but there’s also a snap button inside the Velcro for more security. There’s also a silicone backing in the phone pocket so your phone doesn’t slip out if it’s upside down. There’s also a little pocket for your gel if you take that on your run. It’s very comfortable; I didn’t have any issues with it. I have a size M/L. This vest is a must for any run or hike.",5.0,5,none
11,"Before I was running with my watch only and left my phone in the car, but I like taking my phone out for pictures, this solved my problem and the water pack is just a plus",5.0,4,none
12,This is very light and not noticeable as far as being cumbersome while running. All my friends have themIn our running group now. Thanks for a great product.,5.0,5,none
13,This vest is nice and easy to use. It has plenty of storage as well as fits over larger chest women.The first order placed was too small but customer service team immediately reached out and made the swap for a new size and were extremely friendly and professional. Definitely recommend for a hiker or runner,5.0,5,size
14,Love it! Works perfectly!,5.0,5,none
15,"The vest has plenty of pockets for whatever you need to carry. The straps are adjustable and stay in place while excerising. It does get a little warm where the material lays, but other than that I would recommend highly!",5.0,4,none
16,I love how adjustable this vest is due to the simple fact I have big boobs. Also it has two pockets where you can put your keys or phone in. Also comes with a water bottle too ! It is very light weight and very stable. I am purchased this vest and now my running days will be more easier !,5.0,5,none
17,The vest is super lightweight and comfortable. I switched over from a fanny pack and won’t be going back,5.0,5,none
18,Good quality material. Very comfortable. A little tight but fit just right. You have to be on the slim side to be able to fit in it.,5.0,4,none
19,"It’s a perfect fit, lightweight. Perfect for running or short hiking trips.",5.0,5,none
20,I hate running with a phone and water bottle in my pockets! My shorts swaying with the weight of a phone and water bottle is so annoying! Amazon exists and I found this product to help me run! I don’t have to hold my phone and water because this vest does it for me!,5.0,1,none
21,The quality of the vest is great. It’s not too heavy even with the water in it. Also it doesn’t move around while I run. It’s got a cool phone pocket and a smaller pocket for keys or an ID/debit card. Love it!,5.0,5,none

This vest has so many amazing features! Quickly added to my running essentials: https://amzn.to/3vY7qwU",5.0,5,none
23,I had been searching for a smaller vest forever. I got this wore it once and it seemed perfect. Wore it the next time to a huge race i was doing. The straps busted before i even got to my wave line. I was so angry. Had to just put it down and run holding my belongings. Really disappointed.,1.0,1,none
24,"The vest has great storage space and I love the water bottle feature but after my first run, of the bucked straps in the front broke off and I’ve used it two more times and now all three of the front straps are broken and I can’t even use it.",1.0,2,none
25,"The vest is comfortable to wear. It has three thin straps on the front to secure the two sides of the vest together. I would prefer it had two thicker straps instead as I worry the thin straps will break over time. There is an included 500 mL water bottle that fits securely into the front left pocket. The water bottle is very-light weight and does not protrude overly far once inserted into the vest pocket. The vest also includes a pocket for your cell phone as well as a small zippered pocket for valuables such as keys or money. The fabric of the vest is very pliable and breathable, which helps keep you from getting too hot while wearing it. The water bottle includes a mouthpiece where you have to bite down on the straw to allow water to release. While this is useful to prevent wasting water, I worry that the straw will not be able to be properly cleaned and dried over time. The overall cap on the water bottle is flimsy and will likely fail in the future. I would have preferred if the bottle included a second cap with a different drinking mechanism. The back of the vest has a reflective strip for visibility at night.",4.0,4,none
26,"When I first looked at the vest, I wasn't sure how breathable the material would be. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't feel overheated after running 8 miles it in about 80 degree Los Angeles weather. The vest comes with a 17oz soft bottle with a bite spout. The bite spout isn't as easy to use as other spouts of similar design but once you figure out how to use this one, you should have no issues. The pouch that holds the water is also big enough to hold my magnesium gel (in case of muscle cramps).The pocket on the right shoulder strap is big enough to hold gels and other electrolyte/carb snacks. The zip pocket on the left shoulder strap is great to secure you keys.The flip pocket for your phone was big enough for my iPhone Pro Max and its case. When you flip the pocket down, the protective plastic could distort the camera's view so face recognition might not always work.If you're not used to a vest, it takes some getting used to having everything in your chest area. FWIW: I measure out with a 40-42 inch chest and the Large/XL is quite comfortable. You might find yourself tugging on the chest straps every couple of miles, but I never felt the vest move or wabble. I just wanted it to be a bit snugger.All-in-all, I really liked the vest. It was really nice being completely hands free.",4.0,4,none
27,I don't run so did not get for myself but somebody in the family who does. I'm a rather thick guy and I got this to fit me perfectly. The materials all seem to be good quality and durable. I'm not sure what to think about somebaody carrying too much around the breast area but if my family member wants to this has pockets that will hold several items. I have no qualms giving this as a present. If I get feedback once it has been used sometime in the near future I will share.,4.0,4,none
28,"The girls are a little squished. I typically wear a small in everything, and there’s a gap in the back, it’s just my chest size. I love the pockets, and the fact that it’s breathable as I live in a hot state. The water bottle is great since it’s flat, and if you’re near any water fountains to fill. Feels sturdy, except for the straps across the chest feel thin. Otherwise I like the color and product.",4.0,4,none
29,This vest has enough pockets and catch-alls to keep what you need for a day of hiking in reach while keeping your hands free for a walking stick or binocular use. The size is fairly adjustable via straps but may still be too large for big kids and small adults. The back can get sweaty as that section tends to have less air flo than the others. Pretty well made and easy to wipe clean.,4.0,4,none

Thoughtful Detail and Comfortable Material.  Comfortable to wear against skin without much chaffing.This vest is very sleek and attractive with an ""urban"" look and feel.  Very nice detailing and doesn't feel cheap at all.I am a 35 chest fitting a (L-X-Large) size here.  I selected this particular vest because of the features it provides.These include:A generously roomy elastic front chest pocket with draw-pull string and lock mechanism..this sack houses a uniquely designed 17floz Flask (that’s a little bit more than your standard water bottle @16.5) This flask can be removed which leaves plenty room for multiple items wallets, and other various larger items. I really like the concept of the flask, the ingenious design ensures a genuinely leak proof seal.  Similar to the usual squirt bottle that you push up and down to squirt; with this flask you simply uncap the pouch, squeeze with your teeth and use suction.Right above that along the left shoulder strap has a small zip pocket that can fit loose change,lighters, car keys, etc.On the right side of the vest is a special compartment for phones of all sizes (with case).  This compartment also has a hidden stash pouch behind the phone pocket.This phone pocket has unique abilities in that it allows you to use your phone without having to pull it out of the pouch.  You just unsnap the button flap, and the dual stitching assures safety from any accidental drops.  and use your touchscreen without any trouble.  I like the fact that the vest has added velcro around the fastening for extra reassurance of your phones' security.Above the Phone pocket, there is a smaller elastic pocket with velcro to store other small items like ear pods, lifesavers, eg.The slot in the rear of the vest  is perfect for reaching over shoulder for a hand towel/handkerchief in times of exhaustion.The reflective patch on the back of the vest is highly visible from left and right periphery. It also features super reflective accents throughout the logos, vest lining, and pull strings for use during night.  Very nice features to have.  The soft yet durable Lycra Neoprene lining allows easy air flow and breathability for hot days.  Moisture wicking so sweat should not be too invasive.This vest is not intended to support your back or posture in any aspect so don’t expect any type of ‘molding’ or ‘form fitting’.I WOULD NOT recommend this vest for running.. up and down movements due to no true fastening makes the vest become clunky and downright uncomfortable in highly animated activity such as running.I found that no matter how tight I pulled the drawstring to secure the flask it kept getting slumped down into the pouch.  The flask, as it's own apparatus, is actually really nice as a travel companion OUTSIDE of it's designated pouch.. maybe if it were not so flexible and had just a bit more structure it would stand upward in the pocket.Imagine all pockets being utilized as intended..it’s just not ideal.  I think this vest would be much more suitable for camping, security work, fishing, Biking might be ok... I think an upgraded version of this vest would be awesome. Adding larger straps and buckles to the front would actually add more strability against the body when running.  Maybe exchange the spandex flex pocket for a different more durable material that wouldnt allow the heavy items to bounce around so much while running. Also, the small strings in the front might get caught up/snagged in something while outdoors.Otherwise, Solid Product.  Nicely crafted vest with a thoughtful design.  Has a versatile look and very durable.",4.0,4,none
31,"This is nice, however I order L/XL and it is too big. I think it would've been perfect if I got the medium. Super quality tho, there is a pouch for your phone with protection, and a water bottle holder with a water bottle to go in it.",4.0,4,size
32,"This vest has a lot of potential that might make it your next awesome running vest. I took it for a 6 mile run today. I have to wear a badge because of where I run, so I was glad to be able to attach my badge around the phone pocket/flap. I adjusted this down to the smallest it would go. I am 132 lbs and 5’7” so not tiny, but unfortunately the vest still should be a bit smaller for me. It tends to bounce around just a bit too much, and as I ran, the top strap kept loosening so I would have to retighten it. There is a zippered pocket which is nice for keys or whatever but the zipper is metal and makes a slight noise as you run as it taps against itself. The phone pocket is really a great feature. You can use your phone, and it is kept safe and easily accessible. I like being able to access it which is much harder when using a running belt which I typically use. The integrated water bottle really isn’t so great. The construction is cheap, and it’s hard to clean it. The opening is tiny, so it would be very hard to add any powder to your liquid. I won’t be using that bottle, but the good news is my old standby water bottle (Nathan brand 19 fl Oz) fits in the pocket perfectly. The nice thing is the vest kept my hands free and doesn’t weigh much, and it’s comfy to wear. My biggest complaints are: it is too big so it bounces some. The zipper noise is annoying. The water bottle it comes with is garbage. The top strap keeps loosening on its own. But I might use it from time to time if I want to carry more stuff, and it does hold my badge well.",4.0,4,size
33,"First thing to note: this item does precisely what it promises - jiggle-free harness for water bottle and cell phone. Its elastic chest straps do a great job of holding everything tight to the body.  First impression is that the vest is too small, and probably uncomfortable. Wrong! Once you strap in and hit the trail, you realize that the size and the fit are perfect for the task at hand. No matter what you do, the phone and the water bottle stay with you like white on rice. They are held so secure, you forget that they're even aboard. And there is an additional pocket on each shoulder strap, and another big mesh pocket on the back panel. Everything is held snug and secure. I just took it on a hike in high humidity, 90° weather in South Florida. It did a fine job dissipating heat. It did not create hot spots or sweat puddles. Bravo!  The phone pocket is not quite what was promised. Yes, you can use the clear panel as a touch screen - but not very well. At least you can see the screen, without pulling the phone out of its protective pocket.",4.0,4,size
34,"The first thing I noticed was the lightweight and breathable design of the vest. The mesh material allows for excellent airflow, preventing me from feeling overheated or weighed down, even on the warmest days. The adjustable chest straps ensure a snug and customizable fit, which is crucial for preventing bouncing or chafing during my runs.The soft flask is a great addition, providing me with ample hydration without the need to carry a bulky water bottle. The flask is easy to access and refill, allowing me to stay hydrated without interrupting my pace.While the vest is well-designed and functional, I did encounter a few minor drawbacks. The pockets, while sufficient for storing small items, could be a bit larger to accommodate larger items like a phone or energy gels. Additionally, the chest straps sometimes require some fiddling to achieve the perfect fit, but this is a small price to pay for the overall comfort and performance of the vest.Overall, I am very pleased with the  Adjustable Vest. It has become an essential part of my running gear, providing the necessary hydration and comfort to power through my training sessions.",4.0,5,none
35,This is comfortable and fits really well and is easily adjustable but it's very very hot. Like I'm already sweating and now it's sticking to me. I don't have that issue with other Hydration packs. It's a very thick material like a wet suit in a way. But it's still a very good product. Maybe just better for easy hiking rather than anything endurance or sweat inducing.,4.0,4,none
36,"This would be perfect for anyone looking for a high-quality, highly functional bike rider or runner's vest and it FITS them. It's advertised as up to a 44"" chest -- however, I have a 42"" chest, and this is WAY too small. Frankly, my opinion is it would fit a child or a small-framed man or woman quite nicely, but certainly not an average-sized man. Otherwise, this vest gets high marks for quality of material and craftmanship, in additional to its outstanding functional features, i.e., phone pocket that unbuttons to flip out; included water bladder and pocket; and reflective strip on the lower back.",4.0,3,size
37,"Definitely good use for smaller size people. I had to give mine to my significant other but she uses it 3x a week and loves it. She’s a size small and it fits perfect, the option to be able to have your phone on you and the sleeve for portable eater bottle is very nice.10/10 would recommend",4.0,5,none
38,"This vest comes with lots of pockets, which I like very much. I can keep my keys, cell phone, water bottle (which it comes with), and other items on me while I run or walk. The vest fits me well and has adjustable straps. The only thing I didn't like is that the straps move too easily. They were stretching out but themselves which caused the vest to become too loose.",4.0,4,none
39,"I really like this running vest! I’ve never been a fan of running with water but once you start training for a marathon, it’s a must. This vest is not too cumbersome or annoying. It holds easily enough water for a long run. The water pockets are easy to access while running. It’s very breathable and light. It has reflective material if you wanted to run in the dark hours and use it to help be seen by cars.",5.0,5,none
40,"Omgoodness!  I literally just had a problem with my cell phone falling out of my hoodie pocket again while jogging yesterday.  This Zelvot run vest is amazing.  I like the way it fits; not to long, heavy or cumbersome.  In fact it is very lightweight.There are pockets for almost everything you need while exercising.  Keys, cell phone, Chapstick and even a water bottle, which was provided, by the way!  The pocket that holds the phone unsnaps and flips down so that you can review the screen for calls, texts, etc.  Very well thought of.  And there is hidden pocket in the back of the vest for, say...a small sweat towel, perhaps?I wore it to the gym today and a lady took a picture of it and said she was going to order one for herself. It provides the convenience and accommodations I have been seeking.  I highly recommend this vest to anyone in need of the same.",5.0,5,none
41,"I wear half dozen running vests, which one depends on the occasion. I am giving this vest a five star for a few reasons even though I could change a few things.First off as much as I would love to go out without my phone it just isn’t going to happen. This vest has the perfect pocket to carry a large phone and be able to use it without removing it from the vest. The flip down pocket allows you to access your phone without stopping.I wish it came in colors other than the sun heat absorbing black I have in it. The fabric does have small holes evenly spaced through out for breathability. The is a giving stretch to the fabric, yet is a bit heavier than my other vests. Nice large reflective strip on the back for low light visibility, car head lights reflect well. This area also has an open pocket, you could store extra water or for me a small rain poncho along the spine.Comes with a bite valve collapsable bottle. Now this took many soaks to get rid of the plastic taste, I almost gave up but you can get through a run in the heat before the water starts to taste funny. I don’t know why running bottles and bladders always tastes like plastic when throw away ones don’t. They just need extra care.The cross straps are easy to work, and there are three for fine adjustments across the chest. With that being said, this vest is a bit large on me and I will probably have to use it for short runs or in the winter when I am wearing a jacket as the edges rub my arms while running and will cause chafing on long runs. I think this will vary on the user due to body shape.Small pockets on both sides near collar bone, one is a zipper and one is a velcro. Holds a few gels, chap stick or tissues etc.I had to leave this out in the sun a few days to get rid of the manufacturing odor.Over all I think it is a good vest, I would like an option for color to not absorb so much heat from the sun and size choices to reduce weight and improve fit.",5.0,4,none
42,"I've been looking for that perfect running vest that has everything I need to run in 90 degree+ heat with humidity, sun and long miles.  The fabric on this vest is very soft and comfortable.  I like that the phone pocket it water/sweat proof.  Your phone can fit in the pocket that has a clear side that allows you to use face recognition and you can easily see your phone, change workout, songs, answer call, etc just by unsnapping it and it folds down.  You don't have to take the phone out.  This is exactly what I was looking for when looking for a sweat proof phone holder for my very long runs.  The water bottle is interesting.  It is a very squishy, lighweight collapsible clear bottle.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to grip it to take it in and out of the pocket, but realized I just had to pull it up enough to be able to reach the nozzle and it is a bite and drink nozzle, so I actually didn't have to take it all the way out.  There aren't enough other pockets for what i like.  There are two small pockets on either shoulder but they are up pretty high so kinda hard to reach.  The pocket on the back is not big enough for a bladder and the water bottle for the pocket does not hold enough water for my really long runs.  There is not another water/sweat proof pocket for a small towel either.  Pretty pink color.",3.0,5,none
43,"This vest has it all.  It has a place for your phone that, once secured, allows you to pull down the flap it’s in and see the screen through the clear plastic window.  But, the flap is secured with both Velcro and a snap.  You have to really want to look at your phone.  The touch screen worked great for me with my Pixel 6 Pro.  There is another storage area behind the phone sleeve (it’s in the same velcroed flap as the phone goes in).  I don’t know what I’d put in there, but I’d say you could fit a passport or something of a similar size in it.  This vest also has a zippered pocket on the left shoulder—perfect for a key or credit card or ID—and a small velcroed pocket on the right shoulder, which could easily hold some lip balm.  It comes with a collapsible bite-valve water bottle, though you will need to make an effort to get the plastic taste out of it.  It has a reflective strip on the back.But, most importantly, this vest will not move as you run.  It is very secure and stable.  The mesh back makes it pretty breathable, and it’s definitely lightweight and very comfortable.For reference, I’m 5’7”, 126#, 34C, and this fit perfectly on the tightest strap setting.",5.0,5,none
44,"Tested this baby out hiking this last weekend.... I LOVE IT.  I have several things that I love about this vest:1.  The areas with the holes are almost like the body glove fabric so it breathes really well and has a sort of cooling effect.2.  The cell phone pocket is amazing! I love that you can put your phone in there and if you wanted to change your music you can either leave it hanging while you are running or you can Velcro it up and pull it down to change the music.  This is life changing because I no longer have to worry about dropping my phone while I'm running or needing to stop to change my music3.  The water bottle has a bite valve so you can get water out of it without even removing it from the pocket4.  The zipper pocket on the left shoulder is large enough for a key fob which is really nice!The only thing that I wish this vest had was a metal loop to hook my dog to but honestly, I'd buy this vest again regardless of that.",5.0,5,none
45,"The Zelvot Running Vest for Women and Men is a practical and well-designed piece of gear, ideal for those who enjoy daily walks or runs. One of the standout features is that it comes with a water bottle, though I prefer not to place it in the designated pocket as it tends to add extra weight. Despite this, the vest itself is incredibly lightweight and comfortable to wear.An important note is that the vest has a size limit, so be sure to check the sizing to ensure a proper fit. The adjustable chest straps help achieve a secure and customizable fit, but verifying the size beforehand is crucial.The touchscreen pocket is a fantastic addition—it's sweatproof, which is perfect for keeping your phone dry. I appreciate the convenience of being able to unbuckle the vest without my phone falling out, thanks to the secure Velcro patch. Overall, this running vest has become my go-to for daily walks, offering a combination of comfort, practicality, and thoughtful design features.",5.0,4,none

47,"I really like this hydration vest.  It has adjustable front straps to loosen or tighten to fit you just right.  It comes with a hydration flask that will carry 1-2 hours of water while you are active.  What I like about this the most is it has a clear phone holder that snaps and velcros open and close, so you can easily view who is calling or control your music while you are on the go.  The fabric is lightweight and breathable, though not as much as pure mesh.  Also, the vest has a back pocket and a reflective strip to keep you safe at night.  Overall, this is a great product, especially for the price point!",5.0,4,none

62,"Got this for my daughter who runs track. She runs every day on her own and I'm always afraid she's gonna dehydrate.  I should've paid better attention.  She has a small frame, so we didn't want anything very big and bulky for her.  But, even though this one is lightweight and NOT bulky, it only carries a 500ml bladder, which is roughly 16 ounces.  That's 2 cups of water.  And, even though you're not supposed to drink A LOT when you're running because it can upset your stomach, when she's running several miles per day in the hot Texas heat, 2 cups is not near enough.",3.0,4,none

67,"The vest is comfortable on the tightest setting for me but not for long-the fasteners at the front slip out of place very easily resulting in me having to adjust it every few minutes, which believe me is very annoying! The only thing I liked about this vest is the phone holder and extra pockets for keys.update: customer service sent me a replacement in Pink (so pretty!) and the straps no longer has this issue. The updated product is truly amazing and I have nothing bad to say about it except that it can get a bit hot in summer.",5.0,2,none

The lightweight, breathable material keeps me cool, and the vest has ample storage for essentials with secure zippers. Reflective strips ensure high visibility for safety during low-light runs. The durable build quality shows no signs of wear after weeks of use. Highly recommended for any runner!",5.0,5,none

72,"package says for women and M/L. How an outfit can be Medium and Large at the same time when it is not stretchable.I think this style is more suitable for small size chest person. M/L is rally XS for a men.Phone location at front and water at the back good design.  Material is heavy duty may not suitable for a long distance runner. For hiking and walking and jogging is good for people who don't want to wear a belt.I noticed another L/XL version of listed of this product another site. I would imagine this will be lower.price fort M/L was ok, however L/XL is +cad$15 more.  At that price range Osprey's new designs starting at cad$100. Price for M/L for small body will fit and price is reasonable for good design. Too bad it didn't  have more sizes listed in the same product page. In Product description it should indicate minimum chest size. Rather than indicating M/L. This is not how it should be sold.",3.0,3,none
73,"La veste est pratique, belle, je l’adore. Par contre elle n’est pas fait pour les très grosses poitrines. Sinon, super légère je ne la sens même pas sur moi. Et que dire de la gourde souple qui vient avec 🤩 c’est beau, pratique et ' génial 🙌🏼",5.0,4,none
